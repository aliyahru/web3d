    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>For my website, I created a portfolio where you can learn more about my skills and hobbies. I used Three JS to
        display and animate the models I created.</p>
    <h2>3D Modelling</h2>
    <p>I used Blender to 3D model everything seen on this website.</p>
    <p>I chose a low poly style to reduce the loading times for the models. The textures are materials created in
        Blender. The glass on the camera is a material created through Three JS as importing it from Blender doesn't
        work.</p>
    <p>For the 3DS, I rigged the model using an armature which is something I've never done before. </p>


    <div class="container-fluid image-container">
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-8">
                <img class="img-fluid" src="assets/images/3dsRig.PNG" alt="Armature rig for 3DS model.">
                <figcaption>3DS with its rig.</figcaption>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
    <br>
    <p>I created a camera in Three JS and used Three JS's orbit controls in order to allow the user to view the model
        and zoom in and pan around the canvas</p>
    <p>For the camera, I used shape keys in order to control the rotation of the shutter as well as the button seen on
        top. If these were two separate animations, it would have been more difficult to ensure that they played at the
        same time, but by joining the objects together they maintained their animation, but it counted as one.</p>

    <h2>Design</h2>
    <p>I created a wireframe view of the website using Figma, so I could decide how each page would be laid out.</p>
    <p>I used Bootstrap to create most of the features on the website including the navigation bar, card view for the
        hobbies section on the home page and a lot more. I also heavily made use of containers, rows and columns to
        structure the components and allow the components to resize on different devices.</p>
    <p>The website's design also has a consistent colour scheme and I have added small features such as an animation
        when hovering over the navbar to make the website more interactive and interesting.</p>
    <p>For the code snippet on this page, I used <code>prism.js</code> in order to style it.</p>

    <h2>Integration</h2>
    <p>The images on the hobby cards on the home page are renders of the models I created with a toon shader I created.
        For the camera model, you can hear a shutter click when it is animated.
        I have also used prism.js to stylise any code blocks I display on the page.</p>
    <p>On the skills page, the model interacts with the content of the page, as clicking on certain areas toggles the
        content of an accordion.</p>
    <p>I have included other media content across the pages, including images like seen on this page, a slideshow on the
        hobbies page, and a video that I created myself on the homepage.</p>

    <h2>Interaction</h2>
    <p>All of the canvases have orbit controls to move the models on the page. On the Hobbies page, you can view a
        wireframe of the model, play an animation as well as switch the model and content of the page. On the skills
        page, you will notice that camera movement is limited, you cannot move the camera up and down and sideways much
        or zoom out. This is a feature and not a bug! I did this so that the desk remains the focus of the canvas when
        interacting with it.</p>
    <h2>Implementation</h2>
    <p> I tested my website in week 11 by allowing other students to navigate my website and provide verbal feedback. I
        would say this was an example of a user interview and usability testing. I found that users were able to easily
        navigate my website using the navigation bar, but when it came to changing content on the hobbies page, they
        would
        often miss the button “next” that changed the page. I centered the buttons and content so they were more
        visible, as well as adding a tip at the top of the page.</p>

        <div class="container-fluid image-container ">
        <div class="row ">
            <div class="col-md-5 mx-auto">
                <img class="img-fluid" src="assets/images/HobbiesBefore.PNG" alt="Hobbies page before feedback.">
                <figcaption>Hobbies page before feedback.</figcaption>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-5 mx-auto">
                <img class="img-fluid" src="assets/images/HobbiesAfter.PNG" alt="Hobbies page after feedback.">
                <figcaption>Hobbies page after feedback.</figcaption>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>

    <h4>Regression Testing</h4>
    <p> I also continuously tested my website when adding new features through the use of the developer tools found
        on browsers (I predominantly used Firefox). I found the console log particularly useful. </p>
    <h4>Cross Platform Testing</h4>
    <p> I tested my website on different platforms (Windows and Android) to see how the UI looked and to
        ensure features worked correctly. I was especially focused on how the Minesweeper game I implemented
        would work. On PC, you left clicked to reveal a cell and right clicked to flag a cell. Obviously on
        phone you can’t right click, but I found that long pressing did the same thing. </p>
    <h4>Cross Browser Testing</h4>
    <p> I also tested my website on different browsers such as Chrome as web design elements can act
        differently (or not work at all) on different browsers, as well as the design varying
        slightly</p>


    <h2>Deeper Understanding</h2>
    <p>JavaScript is a critical part of making this website work, and has also allowed me to introduce some more
        advanced features. Alongside this, Three JS has a lot of advanced features that can be used in interesting ways.
    </p>
    <h4>Minesweeper</h4>
    <p>On the hobbies page, you may have noticed that you can play Minesweeper! All of the logic including generating
        where the bombs are, keeping check of how many bombs remain and the timer are all done using JavaScript. I also
        made use of localstorage to store the player's best time. I used the tutorial seen <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/create-a-minesweeper-game-using-html-css-javascript/">here</a> as a starting point, and
        developed the logic further as this tutorial results in a very barebones project.</p>
    <h4>Dark Mode</h4>
    <p>I implemented a dark mode toggle for my website. You can find the toggle for dark mode in the footer of the page,
        and all of the elements will change to a more dark friendly version. When changing pages and leaving and
        returning to the website (on the same device), the dark mode should still persist. Again I have used
        localStorage in order to make this possible.</p>
    <div class="code-container col-md-6 container-fluid">
        <pre><code class="language-js">    let darkMode = localStorage.getItem("darkMode") == "true";
    const checkbox = document.getElementById('darkToggle');
    if (darkMode) {
      var element = document.body;
      document.body.setAttribute('data-bs-theme', 'dark');
      checkbox.checked = true;
    }
        </code></pre>
    </div>
    <h4>Raycaster</h4>
    <p>Three JS has a raycaster, allowing you to detect where in a canvas a user is pressing and also what objects are
        being pressed. I have used a raycaster on the skills page to detect when certain models are pressed, which
        triggers different content on the page to be visible.</p>
